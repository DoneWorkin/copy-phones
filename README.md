# copy-phones
This simple Python application simplifies copying photos from our phones to our blog memory stick.
It uses tkinter for the UI so it will work on both Linux and Windows.

Notes that make this mostly unsuitable for anyone else:

1. This requires your phone to be in developer mode for ADB commands to work
2. You need to install ADB and have it properly working
3. You need to install BetterADBSync
4. This is hard coded to our two phones (Editable at the top of the code)
5. This is hard coded to moving the files to our specific Blogging memory stick (Editable at the top of the code)
